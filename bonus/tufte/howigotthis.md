so i was on this website of Johnny Nelson's: https://generativist.falsifiable.com/index.html when i noticed he very kindly mentioned where he got this theme in his footer. 

lo and behold, the tufte guy that this theme is named after is really a character. he's a revolutionary designer and artist and i have much to learn. 

apparently this style sheet is supposed to replicate tufte's style of handouts. i am interested in trying this out because a) i like the layout, with its two functional columns, and b) i've never used a style sheet before but i am very much hoping it will make modifying websites like mine a lot easier. 

the world is so big,
