        <h2> I am also interested in how the sample index for this theme uses articles and sections. </h2>
        <p>I want to try using some of the elements within this index (that I'm literally reading as I type this). I am still not super sure about how to use divs or how/when to merge CSS with html. to be truthful, enough of my website so far is a mishmash of different websites' advice, that it's hard to tell if I'm doing any of it consistently. to first tries!</p>
