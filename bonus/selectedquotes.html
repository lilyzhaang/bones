    <p> I am a hoarder. I should get better at curating and displaying. At the time of this writing I have 200 entries in my to-read list - not just a bookmarks list, a serious list of things that I think are valuable to read. 

Maybe they’re my creature comforts, but seriously I love having my clothes, my books, and my knick knacks around me. I should really get rid of some of this stuff.

<p>I just get a new keyboard! It is a Cherry Blue keyboard with 104 keys. I’m very excited about it. I think I will hopefully have a lot more fun writing essays, these thoughts, and stories about things I’ve been doing in New York. I’m looking forward to getting a lot better at typing and writing more!

    <p style="font-style:Oblique">There’s an aesthetic my brother calls “globby Americana”: imagine roadside attractions of inexpertly rendered fiberglass dinosaurs and knobbly concrete totem poles, yard sale papier-mâché sculptures. Globbiness of form suggests a sloppy-yet-heartfelt artistic perspective, a sincerity so profound it invokes a little disgust. A gustatory equivalent can be found in the mayonnaise- or whipped cream-drenched dishes generously called salads and found on potluck tables across the United States. It’s these aspects of Americana—the wholesome cultural products that verge on the grotesque—that most fascinate the artist Jim Shaw.</p>

<p>The wonderful thing

  <br>
about looking up 
<br>
  <br>
is that you never have to look down
<br>
  <br>
and your neck starts to hurt

<p>I think somewhat surprisingly I’ve been turning away from the idea of having kids in the future. That has always seemed like a constant in my culture and in my beliefs for my future, but there are just so many parts of life and being that seem so hard and so unreasonable to bring someone into. 
<br>
  <br>
Climate, for example. This is, very much, not a drill. But that depressing fact that the degree to which consumer action could actually change things is minimal lingers in my head. It’ll be consumers forcing governments forcing corporations, and that seems impossible. 
<br>
  <br>
Then, in my Ethics & the Internet class, it seems all we discuss is how our power over our digital existence has been eroded to dust. What is there to look forward to?

I think my generation and my lifetime might be the last to “have it good”. We’re already in a capitalist trash fire (in terms of the financial world, at least) - I don’t want to see the rest of it burn. </p>

<p>I think... the unfortunate thing I’ve been thinking as of late is, why do people like me? why do people love me? 
<br>
  <br>
Dating is, in some ways, a very uncomfortable thing to me. I don’t want to get to know you or for you to get to know me... I would like for you to know me, then want to date me. I can’t help but shake the feeling that people think I’m cute and then want to hang out with me. What does that say about me? 
<br>
  <br>
And further, I am fully aware that my first impression tends to be my best one. I’m usually happy and cheery and excited to see people. I’m better at conversation with new friends than with old friends. But I know better than others do, that what I find most exciting about myself is not just my friendly demeanor. 
<br>
  <br>
So I guess that boils down to, what would people love about me? Why does it discomfort me so much that, I don’t feel accurately represented in that first instance of me? Is that Leo energy of mine so strong? I worry that I become entertainment value, and not person value. That I’m fun to have at parties but less so other places.

<p>there is something so fun about visiting websites in different languages! even when they’re not particularly complex or even interesting, just the fact that it is foreign to me is a little exciting.
