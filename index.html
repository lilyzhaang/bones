    <p> this website will first be my repository for the content i already have. i typically write on my notion about what i've been up to in my few semesters of undergraduate studies, what media i've been enjoying, and all the luscious angsty scribbling of a 20-something. so i hope to move that here, in the hopes that one day when i'm actually good at html/css/whatever, i can pretty easily adapt this into something beautiful! </p>
