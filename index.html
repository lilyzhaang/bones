      <p> this website will first be my repository for the content i already have. i typically write on my notion about what i've been up to in my few semesters of undergraduate studies, what media i've been enjoying, and all the luscious angsty scribbling of a 20-something. so i hope to move that here, and that one day when i'm actually good at html/css/whatever, i can pretty easily adapt this into something beautiful! 
<br>
        <br>
        on another note, please be gentle - this website was built by me, from scratch, and with love. cheers!
