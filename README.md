# bones
this is going to be the bones of my website. hopefully I'll be able to load this up with all of my content so it will be forever mine, free, and shareable. 

as of may 9, 2022, 2:19 AM EST, this is where I'm at. so far I'm pretty happy with it, especially as I've loaded it up with more content. I have more of a sense of how I think the overall site structure will look, which is more to say than any of my prior attempts. I also - though embarassingly simple - finally figured how to go back up a path (which was the boon of my process last 2 times). It just took a while to figure out that the logic that you'd have to go INTO files applies for when you have to go OUT OF files! 

as of may 10, 2022, 7:36 PM EST, i've decided that: all the pages EXCEPT for those under "stuff i write lol" will have the "header 1", "click me to go home!", and "click me to read more" links to the center. 

those pages that are under "stuff i write lol" will have all three of those elements left-aligned within the box. i think that looks best for the wall of text that those writings are.
