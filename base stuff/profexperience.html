    <h2> where i started. </h2>
    <p> I grew up very lucky and very privileged. I never had to work before I made it college. when I did make it to college, however, I was incredibly daunted by the scope and difficulties of joining the professional community. NYU Stern itself is a particularly careerist environment. heck, in my first semester of school I was introduced to dramatic job titles like investment banking analyst, forensic accountant, and product manager. these were things I had never interacted with before. the spring of my freshman year in 2020 was also the spring that the COVID-19 pandemic hit. all at once, NYU students rushed back home or locked down for dormitory quarantine. I was lucky enough to head home to Georgia to comfortably quarantine with my family. in that time, however, I realized that my first work experience ever would be virtual, and that it would be changing the way I learned. my sister, who had just started her first full-time job, was in a similarly strange position. so I scrambled online through websites likle angellist, handshake, and linkedin, scrounging for any opportunities that were taking freshmen. and one of them bit! and thus I had my first work experience at an up-and-coming pre Series A startup. more on that now. </p>
 
    <p> while I was in my search, I was completing an on-campus mentorship program at the NYU Stern Strategic Venture Society. as a Venture Team Analyst, I got my first taste of preparing investment decks, conducting due diligence, and experimenting with things like Python, Figma, and DCFs. i've attached my (first ever!) work samples to show you've what I've learned from all that jazz. </p>

    <h2> where i'm (hopefully) going. </h2>
    <p> certainly, a lot of this is based on who gives me a job! but some of the things i'm interested in are things like fintech, consumer goods, and venture. I think one of the things really makes me excited is working through strategy. i teach a mentorship program for the strategic venture society now, called Startup Studio, where I go over a few high level strategic elements of a startup with a group of students. they end up pitching their own idea to us and how they'd handle the big questions: product-market fit, monetization strategy, go-to-market strategy. it really excites me to work through the incentives of each part of the business model, and how or if they work together. that's what i'm hopefully looking forwards to. some kind of venture studio or even idea incubator. i'd love to be able to work across new concepts but get deep enough to establish something. just a thought! </p>
    
    <h2> restaurant sales intern @ sharebite. </h2>
    <h3> remote, company based in New York, NY. june 2020 - july 2020. </h3>

    <p> this was it! my first time working. it was also a fantastic dive into the deep end of sales, something that still spooks many an experienced employee. 
    
    I would say that the three most valuable things I learned from this particular experience were: how to ask for feedback and give feedback, how to hold my ground in a professional setting, and how to take the intiative. while those three things are somewhat obvious, for a first-time professional, I learned so much. 
      
      firstly, in "asking and giving feedback". I signed up for two performance reviews during my two months, but I also constantly workshopped with my manager. while I disagreed in some ways with how feedback was given, I realized that the best solution to get over my discomfort with being on the phone, doing cold calls, was to accept the feedback and try to internalize it. it's not just tennis practice anymore. the cold calls and sales I was closing were critical to the national expansion project at Sharebite at the time. Understanding and adapting the feedback to make it work for me, really improved my experience. in giving feedback, I took notice of how I felt when I accepted feedback and tried to tailor around those feelings. 
      
      secondly, I learned how to hold my ground! when making cold calls, especially to tired and worn-out customers like restaurant owners during the pandemic, I faced many a frustrated decision maker. that's okay - the restaurant industry is totally the ones screwing with their business model. but being on the end of that frustration was hard to stomach, especially for a young 17/18 year old. getting used to that and successfully working against it made me really proud. 
      
      lastly, this experience taught me to go out and try. I got the internship by cold-emailing the contact on Handshake. I started a coffee chat rotation because I saw the feedback in our intern group chats and acted on it. I got to speak across the company because I set aside time for it. there really are so many opportunities if you just ask for them. this is something that I realized I was never taught growing up. instead, I was taught to work hard, which is fair, but I realize now that the best combination is probably she who is both hardworking and ambitious.
