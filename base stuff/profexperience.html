    <h2> where i started. </h2>
    <p> I grew up very lucky and very privileged. I never had to work before I made it college. when I did make it to college, however, I was incredibly daunted by the scope and difficulties of joining the professional community. NYU Stern itself is a particularly careerist environment. heck, in my first semester of school I was introduced to dramatic job titles like investment banking analyst, forensic accountant, and product manager. these were things I had never interacted with before. the spring of my freshman year in 2020 was also the spring that the COVID-19 pandemic hit. all at once, NYU students rushed back home or locked down for dormitory quarantine. I was lucky enough to head home to Georgia to comfortably quarantine with my family. in that time, however, I realized that my first work experience ever would be virtual, and that it would be changing the way I learned. my sister, who had just started her first full-time job, was in a similarly strange position. so I scrambled online through websites likle angellist, handshake, and linkedin, scrounging for any opportunities that were taking freshmen. and one of them bit! and thus I had my first work experience at an up-and-coming pre Series A startup. more on that now. </p>
 
    <p> while I was in my search, I was completing an on-campus mentorship program at the NYU Stern Strategic Venture Society. as a Venture Team Analyst, I got my first taste of preparing investment decks, conducting due diligence, and experimenting with things like Python, Figma, and DCFs. i've attached my (first ever!) work samples to show you've what I've learned from all that jazz. </p>

    <p> this was it! my first time working. it was also a fantastic dive into the deep end of sales, something that still spooks many an experienced employee. </p>
