    <h2> where i started. </h2>
    <p> I grew up very lucky and very privileged. I never had to work before I made it college. when I did make it to college, however, I was incredibly daunted by the scope and difficulties of joining the professional community. NYU Stern itself is a particularly careerist environment. heck, in my first semester of school I was introduced to dramatic job titles like investment banking analyst, forensic accountant, and product manager. these were things I had never interacted with before. the spring of my freshman year in 2020 was also the spring that the COVID-19 pandemic hit. all at once, NYU students rushed back home or locked down for dormitory quarantine. I was lucky enough to head home to Georgia to comfortably quarantine with my family. in that time, however, I realized that my first work experience ever would be virtual, and that it would be changing the way I learned. my sister, who had just started her first full-time job, was in a similarly strange position. so I scrambled online through websites likle angellist, handshake, and linkedin, scrounging for any opportunities that were taking freshmen. and one of them bit! and thus I had my first work experience at an up-and-coming pre Series A startup. more on that now. </p>

    <p> this was it! my first time working. it was also a fantastic dive into the deep end of sales, something that still spooks many an experienced employee. </p>
